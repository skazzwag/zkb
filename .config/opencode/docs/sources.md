Design basis: exact user-supplied Guide README in reference/motherduck-guides-readme.md. The complete PR/scripts/metadata and CI were not supplied; README intent is not evidence of implementation correctness.

MotherDuck's documentation connector confirmed separate identities for dev/prod, account-owned development databases and read-only input shares. It did not establish your actual grants or cached-credential precedence. References returned:
- https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/data-warehousing/environment-management/
- https://motherduck.com/docs/concepts/resource-management/
- https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/service-accounts-guide/impersonate-service-accounts/

The dev runner is custom code. Its operation against your installed dbt/Core/adapter, macros, schema routing and MotherDuck credentials must be accepted locally. No live warehouse or Guide queries were performed. Existing native Altimate and notebook runtime limits remain.
